# PEEGO
 Point Exchange Efficient Global Optimisation (PEEGO) algorithm. This repository is associated to the paper "Computer-aided Design of Formulated Products: a Bridge Design of Experiments for Ingredient Selection"
 
 ## Description
 This repository contains the following:
  
  * The source file for the PEEGOAlgorithm R package, 'PEEGOAlgorithm_0.1.tar.gz'. It contains the function for the point exchange algorithm used to find optimal designs for the formulated product experiment.

  * A folder containing the commented source code for the functions in the PEEGOAlgorithm package, 'Source Code for Functions in PEEGOAlgorithm Package.' Each of the .R files in this folder gives the commented source code for the functions in PEEGOAlgorithm and their help file.

  * Commented R code demonstrating how to use the PEEGOAlgorithm package, 'Finding a Design Using the Point Exchange Algorithm.R.' 

  * Example R code for running a simulation for multiple random starts using the code in Finding a Design Using the Point Exchange Algorithm.R,' 'Example Simulation - Multiple Random Starts.'

  * Commented R code for finding the optimal design from a simulation with multiple random starts, 'Finding Optimal Design from Multiple Random Starts.R.'

  * Commented R code for finding the prior distribution used in the utility function, 'Model Selection for Prior.R.'
